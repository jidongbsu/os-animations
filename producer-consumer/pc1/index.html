<h1>The Producer/Consumer (Bounded Buffer) Problem Broken Solution 1</h1>
<p>Producer/Consumer: Single CV And If Statement</p>
<p>In the example first the consumer 1 runs and because the Buffer is Empty it goes to sleep waiting for a signal.</p>
<p>Then the producer 1 runs and fill the buffer and send the signal that wakes up consumer 1 but the consumer 1 doesnt get to run next.</p>
<p>OS choose consumer 2 to run and it consumes buffer content and then OS switch to consumer 1.</p>
<p>Now consumer 1 wants to get the buffer content but the buffer is empty and error happens.</p>
